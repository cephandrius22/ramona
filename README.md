This is my attempt at following along with https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview.

I've written a couple raytracers in C for school and even worked through parts of this book before, but I wanted
to work through it again while writing my own code in Rust. I think there is a Rust equivalent to "Raytracing in a Weekend"
which I plan to look at, but I wanted to reason through it myself at first.
